REM loopback-down.cmd - stops Loopback (counterpart of loopback-up.cmd):
REM   1) docker compose down   (the database volume and result files are kept)
REM   2) removes the bridge's logon autostart
REM   3) stops the Claude bridge
REM
REM The bridge's port is held by Windows' HTTP.sys (PID 4), so it is stopped by its
REM command line (dotnet ... claude-bridge.fsx), not by "kill whatever listens on the port".
